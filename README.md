# Minitalk ðŸ“¶ (42 School Project)

A simple client-server program demonstrating inter-process communication (IPC) using only **UNIX signals** (`SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The client process sends a string message to the server process, which then displays it. Communication is achieved by encoding the string **bit-by-bit** into signals.

---

## âœ¨ Features

*   Server displays its **PID** (Process ID) on startup.
*   Client takes the server `PID` and the message `string` as arguments.
*   Uses `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` **exclusively** for data transfer.
*   Server can handle messages from multiple clients consecutively without restarting.
*   **Acknowledgement:** Server acknowledges message receipt back to the client. *(Bonus)*
*   **Unicode Support:** Correctly transmits and displays Unicode characters. *(Bonus)*
